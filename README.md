### Where is the code and how do I run it?

- The Jupyter Notebook `yelp-dataset.ipynb` is standalone and can be run to generate all intermediate data and train/ test the model.
- It assumes that JSON files from [Kaggle Yelp Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/yelp-dataset/yelp-dataset) are downloaded/ copied into a directory called `data`.
